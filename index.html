<h1>Hello, world</h1>

Emily Chapman is a tech geek based out of Atlanta, GA. She’s worked for MailChimp, Mandrill, and Trello. She’s interested in compassionate customer support, her cat, and amateur improv comedy. Her writing has been published on Lifehacker, HackCollege, and The Toast, and she’s pretty sure she’s the only person with clips from all three places. She performs the first Friday of every month with her all-women’s improv group, Collective 51.  You can find her on Twitter or say hi at emily (at) emchap (dot) com.
